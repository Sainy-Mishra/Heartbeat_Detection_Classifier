# ❤️ Heartbeat Classification: Normal vs. Abnormal 🩺  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **classifying normal and abnormal heartbeats** using **deep learning**. By leveraging **ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals** from the [PTB Diagnostic ECG Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat), we build an **Autoencoder-based anomaly detection model** to identify irregular heart rhythms.  

## 📊 Dataset  
We use the **PTBDB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt Diagnostic ECG Database)**, which contains:  
- ✅ **Normal heartbeats** from healthy individuals  
- ❌ **Abnormal heartbeats** from patients with cardiac conditions  

Each sample consists of **188 time-series features**, representing ECG waveform data.  

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  
### 1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sainy-Mishra/Heartbeat-Detection-Classifier.git
cd heartbeat-classification
